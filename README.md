With over 20 years of experience in software engineering, I have developed, led, and supported a wide range of web, desktop, and mobile applications, using various technologies and frameworks such as JavaScript, Node.js, Postgres, SQLite, Express.js, Tailwind CSS, and Material-UI. More: PhoneGap, Underscore.js, and Obj-C. I have also worked remotely since 2008, mastering the skills and tools required for effective communication, collaboration, and delivery in a distributed environment.

I spent over 13 years at Cornerstone Systems Northwest, Inc., where I held multiple roles such as Engineering Lead, Desktop Client Architect, Lead Mobile Developer, and Web Application Developer. I am most proud of projects that required the collaboration of client, server, and operations stakeholders. During that time, I planned, developed, supported, and maintained various desktop and mobile applications, created a Node.js proxy to route client traffic to multiple endpoints, and led rotating teams of developers, moving between projects to meet deadlines, onboarding and mentoring new developers, and driving our technology assessment and lifecycle management task force company-wide.

I care about computer science, mentoring, and building reliable products, and I enjoy collaborating in distributed teams.

Now: open to senior/staff full-stack or data platform roles.

### **Recent experience**

### **Blog posts and open source contributions**

In 2011, jQuery was about 5 years into being the next big thing. As I built more widgets with it in proprietary systems, I would create and share generic examples of the widgets on my blog. One of those examples was [how to drag n’ drop a list of items and re-order them](https://skfox.com/2010/03/29/jquery-example-selecting-items-with-drag-and-drop/). 

I made a small YouTube demonstration, explanatory screenshots, shared the code in a gist, and offered an [example implementation](https://skfox.com/jqExamples/SortableSelectable.html) to experiment with. 

Performance is an important feature, so I wanted to help other WordPress users gather hard data on how their WordPress site was performing. I built and iterated on a plugin that would provide users with that data and render graphs that gave them the insight they needed to make an informed decision. My plugin is [hosted in the WordPress plugins directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/latency-tracker/) and you can download a zip file that contains the code. It eventually gave me the [information I needed](https://skfox.com/2010/03/12/goodbye-media-temple-hello-web-faction/) to move hosts. 

### **About my work and references**

* Led the effort to create a [Node.js proxy](https://www.cornerstonenw.com/services/web-application-centralizing-proxy/) to route client traffic to multiple endpoints  
* Responsible for developing [client support of PIV cards](https://www.cornerstonenw.com/services/piv-card-implementation/)  
* [Letter of recommendation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18287GKsbKFaGPWVcXxcCgXLRg8BOD7N3/view?usp=drive_link) (Cornerstone Systems Northwest, Inc.)

* Additional [recommendations on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaun-kester/details/recommendations/)

### **Use my software**

After several years of using Basecamp Classic to track our time for billing and project management purposes, we set out to build a frontend app to make it easier and prettier. We wanted to build an app that could talk to the Basecamp API, work offline, and integrate our Google calendars to help us plan our day. After a while, we decided to share that software with the world as our very first SaaS platform. Please take a look at [daycast.com](https://www.daycast.com/) and even try it for free if you like.

My primary responsibility as the client architect at the time was to take what we learned using Electron for another application, and bring it to a public app. 

My work in the Electron space included:

* Offline-capable desktop application for macOS and Windows  
* Saving data for offline use in SQLite  
* In-app updates, including diff updates for both supported operating systems  
* Use cross-process communications to check the OS idle timer to clock out a user automatically if they stopped being active, put their computer to sleep, or shut it down.   
* Display cross-platform notifications that respected Do Not Disturb in macOS and Focus Assist in Windows  
* Allowing local log files to be uploaded with SSH at the request of the helpdesk

I hope I can bring my years of experience and breadth of knowledge to your organization and contribute to your future success as part of the team.
